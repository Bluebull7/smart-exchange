# Smart Contract Exchange System Prototype

## Project Overview

The **Smart Contract Exchange System Prototype** is a simulation-based project demonstrating a decentralized exchange (DEX) where AI agents trade against each other using smart contracts. This project is developed iteratively, starting with a simple single-trade execution between AI agents. The system operates in a controlled, non-live environment using local blockchain simulations.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contract-Based Trading**: Facilitates trades between simulated AI agents on a local blockchain environment.
- **AI-Driven Agents**: Basic AI agents making trading decisions based on predefined logic.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Utilizes smart contracts to ensure trades are executed securely and transparently.
- **Non-Live Environment**: Prototype operates entirely offline, using local blockchain simulations to demonstrate functionality.

## Development Approach

1. **Phase 1: Single Trade Execution** - Initial setup and execution of a single trade between AI agents using a basic smart contract.
2. **Phase 2: Expand Exchange Logic** - Add support for multiple trades and enhance AI decision-making capabilities.
3. **Phase 3: Prototype Interface** - Develop a simple user interface to visualize trades and interact with the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** and **npm**: For managing packages and running scripts.
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.
- **Truffle** or **Hardhat**: For managing smart contracts, compiling, and deploying them.
- **Ganache**: For simulating a local blockchain environment.
- **Python**: For creating AI agents with basic trading logic.
- **MetaMask**: Optional, for simulating wallet interactions if required.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-contract-exchange-prototype.git
   cd smart-contract-exchange-prototype
